    <h2>Patch notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>July 27-28. the plan is just a little (Patch 8: hah, "little") project in jsfiddle. i can save a project and link it from here. i have the images laid out in a table. i need to emphasize the 3 by 3 borders though, so i'll have to change the way i structure the table. The hardest part of all this seems to be generating the damn grid. I'll have to do some research.</li>
      <li>Thanks to <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23206/Sudoku-Algorithm-Generates-a-Valid-Sudoku-in-0-018">this guy</a> I now have a working algorithm written in JS that produces a whole solved sudoku board. I don't know if it's completely bug-free, but it seems to work. Now I gotta poke some holes in it.</li>
      <li>I can now generate sudoku boards. I have not a single clue whether they're correctly generated. (*Refer to Patch 6) I hope to Matsuri my spaghetti is correct. It's quite sloppy, it can't reliably delete every tile it wants to.</li>
      <li>3 by 3 borders now display.</li>
      <li>It is 1:06 A.M. Do you know how difficult it is to write a Sudoku generator? I want to commit sudoku and it's not the kind I'm developing rn /j I need sleep holy hell. Generating the puzzle requires solving the puzzle. For every single space you take out. And if I want it to have any reasonable difficulty, I'll have to make a solver that only uses certain techniques. Which means coding those techniques. Grr. Should've just grabbed a normal generator somewhere.</li>
      <li>Bug in the code means they're probably unsolvable.</li>
      <li>Fixed. Hopefully. It looks like it generates exactly 50 holes (as specified) and the solution in the console seems to check out at first glance because I won't be bothered to check. I'll go play one round and go to bed.</li>
      <li>It's too difficult at 50 holes. I'd putting a setting to lower the number of holes, and code a smarter algorithm, but I've already borrowed too much of tomorrow's time and brain power. I'll just nerf the thing to like 40 and go. Y'all can deal with it. Probably.</li>
      <li>40 holes is still too difficult. It's 2:46 A.M. I started solving at like 2:00. These patch notes are getting too long for Reddit. I'm moving them into the HTML and I'm out of here.</li>
      <li>I have made a hole count thingy. In the process, I have discovered that my program doesn't guarantee that there's only one solution.</li>
      <li>It is currently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwHPgMHPkQ">Sanji Juunihun.</a></li>
      <li>July 29. I made a github account just for this webpage. It's a lot comfier than putting up with JSFiddle, that's for sure. Both on my end and the users'.</li>
      <li>I forgot to mention I fixed the Sudoku board having more than 1 solution. I think. (Patch 18: WRONG) But now I have to limit the number of holes to 50 or else it takes a <b>lot</b> longer to poke more holes.</li>
      <li>July 30. It's 12:41 A.M. I should stop going past midnight honestly. But in any case, I've made a UI that lets you change the tiles. It doesn't have any logic yet, and it's hard to tell which tiles can be edited, but this is major progress.</li>
      <li>It looks quite a bit better now.</li>
      <li>2:58 A.M. It works. You can play the game. <b><i>LET'S GOOOOOOOOO</i></b></li>
      <li>i know kobo is supposed to be a rain shaman and all but what if i summon her and ask her to help with my css</li>
      <li>Remember Patch 13? No? Me neither. I <i>just</i> played a game with 40 holes and there were like 2 solutions where 2 Risu's and Iofi's could switch places. I don't have a screenshot unfortunately.</li>
      <li>Anyway enjoy the new bigger displays for each of the holomems in the tile view.</li>
